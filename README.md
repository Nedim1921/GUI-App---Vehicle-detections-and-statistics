Detection and statistics of vehicles for video files

This project represents a GUI application for vehicle detection and statistics. The project's goal was to create an attractive and user-friendly application. 
For building the application's user interface, I used the PySide2 library and Qt Designer. 
Additionally, for vehicle detection implementation, I utilized OpenCV and the YOLOv8 algorithm. The application also provides an overview of statistics for processed video recordings in the form of graphs, selected by the user.

- On the application's main screen, the user will see the user interface display, containing options for registration and login.
- The application allows users to create user accounts, log in, and manage their video recordings.
- Users can upload video recordings, view them on the list of videos, and select a video for processing.
- The implemented vehicle detection project utilizes OpenCV and the YOLOv8 model for recognizing vehicles in video recordings.
- Processed video recordings are displayed to the user along with the results of vehicle detection.
- The application allows viewing of analytical data and graphical representations for each processed video recording.
- After logging in, the user will be redirected to the main screen with options to search for video recordings, play video recordings, view statistics and graphical representations, as well as a list of selected video recordings for processing.
- The user can select the desired option with a simple click on the corresponding button or navigate through the menu.
- After selecting an option, the application will execute the corresponding actions and display the results on the user interface.
